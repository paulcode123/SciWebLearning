- 🖼️ Image preview before submission
- 📋 Assignment metadata (title, subject, project linking)
- ✅ Support for JPG, PNG, PDF, HEIC formats
- 📏 File validation (max 10MB)

#### 2. **AI Grading Process** (`/grader/process/<id>`)
- 🤖 Animated processing screen
- 📊 Real-time progress indicators
- 🧠 Multi-step AI analysis:
  - Handwriting recognition
  - Content understanding
  - Answer evaluation
  - Feedback generation

#### 3. **Results Display** (`/grader/result/<id>`)
- 🎯 Animated score circle
- 💬 Detailed AI feedback
- 📝 Problem-by-problem breakdown
- ✅/❌ Correct/incorrect indicators
- 🖼️ Side-by-side view with submission
- 🖨️ Print-friendly layout
- 📤 Share results functionality

#### 4. **Grading Dashboard** (`/grader`)
- 📊 Recent submissions overview
- 🏆 Score badges and status indicators
- 📅 Submission history
- 🚀 Quick upload access

### Database Schema

New table: `grade_submissions`
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key → users)
- project_id (Foreign Key → projects, optional)
- title (Assignment name)
- subject (Math, Physics, etc.)
- image_filename (Uploaded file)
- image_path (File system path)
- status (pending, graded, error)
- overall_score (0-100)
- total_points, earned_points
- ai_feedback (Detailed text feedback)
- grading_rubric (JSON - problem-by-problem)
- annotations (JSON - future feature)
- created_at, graded_at (Timestamps)
```

### API Endpoints

1. **POST /api/grader/submit**
   - Handles file upload
   - Creates submission record
   - Returns submission ID

2. **POST /api/grader/grade/<submission_id>**
   - Processes image with AI
   - Generates grading and feedback
   - Updates submission with results

3. **GET /grader**
   - Dashboard with recent submissions

4. **GET /grader/upload**
   - Upload form interface

5. **GET /grader/process/<id>**
   - Processing animation page

6. **GET /grader/result/<id>**
   - Results display page

### How It Works

1. **Student uploads** handwritten work (photo/scan)
2. **AI analyzes** the image:
   - Reads handwriting using vision models
   - Understands mathematical/scientific content
   - Evaluates correctness of answers
3. **Generates feedback**:
   - Overall score (0-100)
   - Problem-by-problem breakdown
   - Constructive comments and suggestions
4. **Student reviews** results and learns from mistakes

## 🎯 Navigation Updates

Added "Grader" button to main navigation:
- Styled with warm gradient (pink-yellow)
- Prominent placement in header
- Icon: graduation cap

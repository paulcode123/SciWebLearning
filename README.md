- **Interactive Chat**: Real-time conversations with AI assistants

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Create a `.env` file (optional) or set environment variables:
     - `FLASK_ENV=development`
     - `SECRET_KEY=change-me`
     - `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///sciweb.db` (or your Postgres URL)
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`

3. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   flask db init && flask db migrate -m "init" && flask db upgrade
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Open Your Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
